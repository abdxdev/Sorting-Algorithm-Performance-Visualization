## Sorting Visualization

We decided to create an interactive web application for visualizing sorting algorithms.

## System Specifications

- **PC1:**

  - Model: Dell Latitude 5400
  - CPU: Intel Core i5-8600K
  - RAM: 16GB DDR4

- **PC2:**

  - Model: Dell Latitude E7250
  - CPU: Intel Core i5-5600K
  - RAM: 8GB DDR4

## Data Variations

The following variations are used to test sorting algorithm performance:

- Many Duplicates
- Nearly Sorted
- Reversed
- Sorted
- Unique Entries
- Random

## Array Sizes

The following array sizes are used to test sorting algorithm performance:

- 1000
- 2000
- 3000
- 4000
- 5000
- 10000
- 20000
- 40000
- 80000
- 160000
- 250000
- 500000

## Time Units

Performance is measured in the following units:

- Millisecond (**ms**)
- Second (**s**)
- Minute (**m**)
- Hour (**h**)
- Nanosecond (**ns**)
- Microsecond (**us**)

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are included in the visualization:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Web Application Link

You can interact with the web application by clicking the link below:
[Sorting Algorithm Visualization](https://sorting-algorithm-performance-visualization.streamlit.app/)

Please allow up to 1 minute for the application to fully load.

The code for this project is available on GitHub:
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/example/sorting-visualization)

## Summary of Visualizations

Each page of the web application includes:

1. **Performance Chart for PC1**
2. **Performance Chart for PC2**
3. **Average Time Chart** (showing the combined average performance of both systems)
